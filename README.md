# What Capital-Rider Does

Capital Rider is a platform that provides a ride sharing communication service between the riders and the passengers. Where users can choose the vehicle type such as bike, car etc to reach their destination. Users can track their their vehicle's location, though this feature is now static, I will make it dynamic soon. 
This project is just for my practice. I will make it more attractive after my semester final exam. I will be free then.

1: Ride sharing app like Uber
